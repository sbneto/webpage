While this page is likely to be permanently under construction and quite outdated, I try my best to keep it up to date. I am a researcher in social networks, applied mathematician and computer engineer. Right now, I am working on my Ph.D. at University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, under the advisorship of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ime.usp.br/~cesar/">Roberto Marcondes</a>, although I currently reside in Ithaca, NY, as a non-degree student at Cornell University, working with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~danco/">Dan Cosley</a>.
