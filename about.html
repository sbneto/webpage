I was born in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and lived there until my 18 years old. As many of my generation, I grew up playing Super Nintendo and talking on ICQ, although I had my affairs with IRC. I got early into programming (or at least trying to), and a very very early version of my personal website <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010804053554/http://www.mrsamhp.hpg.com.br/principal2.htm">can still be found</a> on the internet.
<br><br>
When I was a 14 years old, I got into a <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/8m5vrpPkxEE2">technical school</a> to study "systems' analysis and development". I was doing my high school in the morning, technical school in the night and learning COBOL with a blind programmer (sounds like a joke, right?). It fealt like the Daredevil of programming (and many times I though I should have gone to law school). When you have to spell out loud your 250 lines of COBOL code so that your professor can help you and he catches your error in the first pass, you start to realize how much you still ahve to learn. It is undeniable that I learned a lot with him, and I also had an amazing C professor that got me into real programming. Soon I stopped making silly websites.
<br><br>
After I finished my high school, I considered studing biology, sociology, philosophy, mathematics, physics, engineering and law. It is easy to see that I still had not narrowed down the options by then and, considering that I did not particularly sucked in any of these, life did not make the choice any easier. As every teenager like make lots of mistakes, and I was no exception. So I started with physics. So there I went, 100km away from Sao Paulo, to study at Unicamp. Far enough to be quite tiresome to come back every weekend and close enough for your parents to expect you to do so anyways.
<br><br>
 Physics is all fun and games until your professors start screaming with you because you make questions. My biased sample of physicists with whom I related to soon teached me that there was already too much ego in the department, I mine would not fit in. Fortunately for me, I had very good and equally stubborn friends that kept telling me that I should try applied maths. After two and a half years of physics, I decided to give it a shot.
<br><br>
Applied maths was a whole new world. I really started to appreciate all the tiny details of proofs and theorems, at the same time I got to do some reasonable programming. I quickly focused the next years of my life into optimization and linear programming. It was also around this time that I really got to terms that I would be a bald guy, so I decided to look for insipration in Jean-Luc Piccard, although I was more often compared to Shedon Cooper.
<br><br>
At the same time I was course-jumping, I was also looking for non-academical things to do. Early in my life, someone got me a little into astronomy. Thanks to that, I dedicated good 3 months of my life building my own telescope (I was still in the physics course here, so I can't say it was all bad, I got to use the vacuum lab to evaporate aluminium in my mirror). Also, a very controversial topic is weather or not I can play the guitar. One thing, however, that I was able to do was my own guitar at this time. I never had much of a problem with assembling things like this. But you can only keep a programer for so long far from the programming world.
<br><br>
I am not proud to say that, while my other hobbies at the time seemed quite interesting, I spent quite a lot of my time using my programming skills to create my gold farming tailor macro in EasyUO. I only wish that the castle that it bought me was real. It was a very interesting lesson, nevertheless. Since the desire never really left me, I went yet for another course in my undergrad (but, unlike physics, I finished applied math). I started Computer Engineering (well, started is always an overstatement since you can eliminate half of the course with a math degree), and I covered a lot of missing gaps in my programming skills.
<br><br>
After I finished my undergrad, again, I came back to Sao Paulo. It is worth to mention that I was living with friends all the time and in great part I own to them a lot of what I am and how I was able to endure all the problems and difficultities over two and a half courses and a lot of things that writing down would make this "about me" much less interesting to be read. Being back in the big city, I promptly looked into starting my Ph.D. and, since moving back with my parents is not something that I wanted to do, find a job.
<br><br>
The idea of being 30 years old and having no working experience terrified me, so my first work was already a step in the right direction to not let that happen. Also, late in my undergrad, I really got into Asimov, particularly the Foundation series. I would describe my idea of the doctorate I was pursuing as developing Psychohistory. Well, not a joke many would appreciate. Still, modeling people and predicting their behavior is what I set out to do.
<br><br>
Currently, I am still on the track to get my Ph.D. This short bio is far from being a complete (and some maybe would say faithful) description of me, but at least is how I like to look at myself. I hope to have provided a bit of insight on who I am as a person and, as there is a lot more to be said, I hope to one day be able to write down a more complete version of this document.
