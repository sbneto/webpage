I was born in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and lived there until my 18 years old. As many of my generation, I grew up playing Super Nintendo and talking on ICQ, although I had my affairs with IRC. I got early into programming (or at least trying to), and a very very early version of my personal website <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010804053554/http://www.mrsamhp.hpg.com.br/principal2.htm">can still be found</a> on the internet.

When I was a 14 years old, I got into a <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/8m5vrpPkxEE2">technical school</a> to study "systems analysis and development". I was doing my high school in the morning, technical school in the night and learning COBOL with a blind programmer (sounds like a joke, right?). It fealt like the Daredevil of programming (and many times I though I should have gone to law school). When you have to spell out loud your 250 lines of COBOL code so that your professor can help you and he catches your error in the first pass, you start to realize how much you still ahve to learn. It is undeniable that I learned a lot with him, and I also had an amazing C professor that got me into real programming. Soon I stopped making silly websites.

After I finished my high school, I considered studing biology, sociology, philosophy, mathematics, physics, engineering and law. It is easy to see that I still had not narrowed donw the options by then and, considering that I did not particularly sucked in any of these, it was not clear what I should do.
