Descritpion of my work experience and also some personal interesting projects that I did over the years.

<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="work-item-title"><h3>Development of a distribution system for the brazilian startup <a target="_blank" href="http://www.getninjas.com.br/">GetNinjas</a></h3></span>
        The system interacts with a cloud enviroment and consumes thousands of requests per day finding the best match of professionals for a given service demand. It takes into consideration the geo-location of the professional and the service requester, as well as multiple variables of interest for business and service improvement. Concepts of optimization, clustering and probabilistic distributions are considered in the decision making.

        <span class="work-item-title"><h3><a target="_blank" href="http://www.research.ibm.com/brazil">IBM Research Brazil</a> Intership</h3></span>
        2 years as a research intern at IBM. I developed tools in Java for Twitter crawling and sentiment analysis. Also colaborated with other researchers in areas such as agent based simulation applied to social networks. Was involved into multiple patent application processes.

        <span class="work-item-title"><h3>Research and development for energy distribution systems at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.daimon.com.br/">Daimon</a></h3></span>
        Participated in two projects for major energy distribution companies in Brazil.<br>
        The first one aimed at long term planning for substation construction. I developed all the backend system and algorithms for demand forecast (applied dilatation methods for image processing) and optimal substation construction (a mixed integer linear problem on the possible characteristcs of each substation) and placement heuristics (particle swarm to find the best location in a mesh of 10s of thousands possibilities).<br>
        The second project was an heuristics for optiomal placement of automatic switches in Sao Paulo. I developed a module based on a previously existing genetic algorithm tool that optimized the placement on a single branch of the power network, expanding it to run in the whole network. Also included automated pdf reporting.
        Both projects were done in C++ and the optimizaion tool was GLPK.

        <span class="work-item-title"><h3>2nd place in the 2008 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.greenfoot.org/tags/codepoint-08-general">Codepoint</a></h3></span>
        An Java project for an undergrad class of object oriented programming became the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.greenfoot.org/winners/Castle.jar">Castle</a> game (my design skill are still as good as you can see here, unfortunately), for which I was awarded an Ipod Touch (which at the time was worth something).

        <span class="work-item-title"><h3>An eletric guitar</h3></span>
        Yep, from scratch, including the pickups. 6k spins of a hair-thin copper wire, after the first 1k you are already dreading the possibility of it breaking up. More on this when I find some pictures. =]
    </li>

    <li>
        <span class="work-item-title"><h3>A newtonian telescope on a dobsonian mount</h3></span>
        Bought the glass, grinded, mirroed and assembled. If Newton <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_telescope">did it</a> in the 1600s, why couldn't I? More on this when I find some pictures. =]
