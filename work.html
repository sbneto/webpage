Description of my work experience and also some personal interesting projects that I did over the years.

<ul>
    <li>
        <span class="work-item-title"><h3>Development of a distribution system for the Brazilian startup <a target="_blank" href="http://www.getninjas.com.br/">GetNinjas</a></h3></span>
        The system interacts with a cloud environment and consumes thousands of requests per day finding the best match of professionals for a given service demand. It takes into consideration the geo-location of the professional and the service requester, as well as multiple variables of interest for business and service improvement. Concepts of optimization, clustering and probabilistic distributions are considered in the decision making. Got hooked on Python from here onwards.

        <span class="work-item-title"><h3><a target="_blank" href="http://www.research.ibm.com/brazil">IBM Research Brazil</a> Internship</h3></span>
        2 years as a research intern at IBM. I developed tools in Java for Twitter crawling and sentiment analysis. Also collaborated with other researchers in areas such as agent based simulation applied to social networks. Was involved into multiple patent application processes.

        <span class="work-item-title"><h3>Research and development for energy distribution systems at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.daimon.com.br/">Daimon</a></h3></span>
        Participated in two projects for major energy distribution companies in Brazil.<br>
        The first one aimed at long term planning for substation construction. I developed all the backend system and algorithms for demand forecast (applied dilation methods for image processing) and optimal substation construction (a mixed integer linear problem on the possible characteristics of each substation) and placement heuristics (particle swarm to find the best location in a mesh of 10s of thousands of possibilities).<br>
        The second project was a heuristics for optimal placement of automatic switches in Sao Paulo. I developed a module based on a previously existing genetic algorithm tool that optimized the placement on a single branch of the power network, expanding it to run in the whole network. Also included automated pdf reporting.
        Both projects were done in C++ and the optimization tool was GLPK.

        <span class="work-item-title"><h3>Multiple times as a TA</h3></span>
        I have been a TA since my undergrad. Taught Linear Programming, Numeric Calculus, Methods for Differential Equations in Calculus, Basic Math Proofs and Basic Python. Probably my most significant work here was to develop a GLPK based tool to solve simple linear problems and present them in them in the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm#Simplex_tableaux">tableau</a> form (as seen in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Linear-Programming-Network-Mokhtar-Bazaraa/dp/0470462728">Bazaraa et al.</a>). The code was made in simple C and run as a batch program. I started working on a newer, better version in Visual C++, but I never made it available. Will dig these up when I have some time.

        <span class="work-item-title"><h3>2nd place in the 2008 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.greenfoot.org/tags/codepoint-08-general">Codepoint</a></h3></span>
        An Java project for an undergrad class of object oriented programming became the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.greenfoot.org/winners/Castle.jar">Castle</a> game (my design skill are still as good as you can see here, unfortunately), for which I was awarded an IPod Touch (which at the time was worth something).

        <span class="work-item-title"><h3>An electric guitar</h3></span>
        Yep, from scratch, including the pickups. 6k spins of a hair-thin copper wire, after the first 1k you are already dreading the possibility of it breaking up. More on this when I find some pictures. =]

        <span class="work-item-title"><h3>A Newtonian telescope on a dobsonian mount</h3></span>
        Bought the glass, grinded, mirrored and assembled. If Newton <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_telescope">did it</a> in the 1600s, why couldn't I? More on this when I find some pictures. =]
